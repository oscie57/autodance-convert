# autodance-convert

 A python project to convert Just Dance Wii U Autodances to MP4

 Special thanks to [this GBAtemp post](https://gbatemp.net/threads/extract-just-dance-autodance-video.493341/) for information on how to do this.

## Setup

In order to use this, you will need a Wii U with custom firmware installed, I recommend using [this guide](https://wiiu.hacks.guide/) and installing Tiramisu/Aroma, either should work for this.

You will also need [FTPiiu_everywhere](https://gbatemp.net/threads/libiosuhax-ppc-ipc-library-for-communication-to-dev-iosuhax.449296/) running.
